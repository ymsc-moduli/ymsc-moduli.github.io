The classical Riemann-Roch theorem computes the Euler characteristic of a holomorphic
vector bundle on a compact complex manifold. The algebraic approach to complex analysis,
the D-module language, gives a modern approach to this kind of questions. In this talk we
will sketch the relevant basic elements of the theory of D-modules to the stage where we can
formulate the general form of the Riemann-Roch theorem and, if time allows it, say a few
words about its proof.

			</td>

		 Given a polynomial f, it is difficult to determine the roots of its b-function b_f explicitly. In particular, when f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree d with n variables, it is open to know when n/d is a root of b_f. For essential indecomposable hyperplane arrangements, this is a conjecture by Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Teitler and implies the strong monodromy conjecture for arrangements. In this talk, I will introduce a cohomological sufficient condition given by U. Walther and use this result to prove the n/d conjecture for weighted hyperplane arrangements satisfying the nonresonant condition. This is joint work with Chenglong Yu.

Geometric Galois Representations



			</td>
		         <td  style="width: 500px;">
In this talk, we discuss the irreducibility of compatible systems of certain five-dimensional geometric Galois representations. Using the modularity results of classical cases, we prove that such a compatible system of representations is either irreducible for almost all p, or decompose uniformly as p varies. ​​Our irreducibility result will deduce an algorithm for checking the irreducibility of corresponding Galois representations. Moreover, by applying a result of Cardoret and Tamagawa on the open image theory of monodromy representation, we can spread out the irreducibility among the family of representations induced by the transcendental part of a family of elliptic surfaces, and consequently, verify the corresponding Tate conjecture for those surfaces.

			</td>
		         <td  style="width: 500px;">   
				 In 1967, the same year modern integrable system theory was born, Japanese physicist
Morikazu Toda proposed an integrable lattice model to describe motions of a chain of particles
with exponential interactions between nearest neighbors. Since then, Toda lattice and
its generalizations have become the test models for various techniques and philosophies in
integrable systems and wide connections are built with many other branches of mathematics.
In this talk, I will mention some of these connections and then characterize singular
structure of solutions of the so-called full Kostant-Toda (f-KT) lattices defined on simple
Lie algebras in two different ways: through the τ -functions and through the Kowalevski-
Painlev´e analysis. Fixing the spectral parameters which are invariant under the f-KT flows,
we build a one to one correspondence between solutions of the f-KT lattices and points in
the corresponding flag varieties. This talk is based on preprint arXiv:2212.03679.

In particular, Gamma conjecture I expects that the structure sheaf corresponds to a flat section with the smallest asymptotics. Recently, we discovered that certain toric Fano manifolds do not satisfy this conjecture. 
				 In this talk, we will report our results on these counter-examples, and propose modifications for Gamma conjecture I. This talk is based on joint work with S. Galkin, J. Hu, H. Iritani, C. Li and Z. Su.     </td>

The smallest positive integer m with mK_X linearly equivalent to zero is called the index of X. Using ideas from mirror symmetry, we construct Calabi-Yau varieties with index growing doubly exponentially with dimension. We conjecture they are the largest index in each dimension based on evidence in low dimensions. We also give Calabi-Yau varieties with large orbifold Betti numbers or small minimal log discrepancy.

We propose a conjecture on the log-concavity from E-polynomials of character varieties over Riemann surfaces. Via some 'BPS calculus', we explain an idea of reducing the conjecture to a local one: log-concavity from Severi strata of a versal deformation of planar algebraic curve singularities. In the case when the singularity link is a torus knot, we verify the local conjecture via a connection to the HOMFLY-PT polynomials. Joint work in progress with Chenglong Yu.

For a toric Calabi–Yau threefold, I will explain the correspondence between an equivariant line bundle supported on a toric subvariety and a relative homology cycle on the covering space of the mirror curve. The Laplace transform of the holomorphic Liouville form along this cycle gives genus-zero descendant Gromov–Witten invariants with a certain Gamma class of that bundle. Hence, the Laplace transform of the topological recursion produces all-genus descendant Gromov–Witten invariants with Gamma classes. This talk is based on ongoing joint work with Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu, Song Yu, and Zhengyu Zong.

When a constructible function is restricted to a hypersurface
complement, its characteristic cycle is classically described by
specializing the sharp construction of Ginzburg. When the divisor is
SNC, Maxim-Rodriguez-Wang-Wu recently proved that this process is
equivalent to pulling back the logarithmic characteristic cycle. In this
talk we will discuss some generalizations of this result when the
divisor is free and strongly Euler homogeneous. This is a joint work

(2) Passing to the function field, there are uncountably many non-isomorphic torsors of A_k(S). Finally we discuss some partial results on extending the result to M_g.

We study the cohomology ring of the Bott-Samelson variety. We compute an explicit presentation of this ring via Soergel's result, which implies that it is a purely combinatorial invariant. We use the presentation to introduce the Bott-Samelson ring associated with a word in an arbitrary Coxeter system by generators and relations. In general, it is a split quadratic complete intersection algebra with a triangular pattern of relations. By a result of Tate, it follows that it is a Koszul algebra and we provide a quadratic (reduced) Grobner basis. Furthermore, we prove that it satisfies the whole Kahler package, including the Poincare duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations.

		         	 Let $X$ be a not necessarily smooth Fano variety and denote by \Ku(X) the non-trivial semi-orthogonal component. The Categorical Torelli problem asks if \Ku(X) determines the isomorphism class of $X$. In my talk, I will briefly talk about the history of this topic including the known results and popular strategies to prove these results. Then I will survey the recent advances for (weighted) hypersurfaces, a cubic threefold with a geometric involution, del Pezzo threefold of Picard rank one, and a class of nodal prime Fano threefolds. Meanwhile, I will talk about some new approaches to solving these problems. If time permits, I will also talk about categorical Torelli problems for a class of index one prime Fano threefold as the double cover of del Pezzo threefolds. This talk is based on a series of work joint with Xun Lin, Daniele Faenzi, Zhiyu Liu, Soheyla Feyzbakhsh, Jorgen Renneomo, Xianyu Hu, Sabastian-Casalaina Martin, and Zheng Zhang.

		         	 The Fargues-Fontaine curve has become a fundamental geometric object in the study of p-adic Hodge theory. One of the key theories developed by Fargues and Fontaine concerns the stability condition for vector bundles on this curve. In this talk, we will apply Bridgeland stability conditions to the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. We will see that the Fargues-Fontaine curve presents a strong similarity to elliptic curves. Additionally, we will explore how the hearts defined by slicings of stability conditions generalize the notion of Banach-Colmez spaces.

		         	The Hitchin morphism is a map from the moduli space of Higgs bundles to the Hitchin base, which is generally not surjective when the dimension of the variety is greater than one. Chen-Ngo introduced the concept of the spectral base, which is a closed subscheme of the Hitchin base. They conjectured that the Hitchin morphism is surjective to the spectral base and also proved that the surjectivity is equivalent to the existence of finite Cohen-Macaulayfications of the spectral varieties. For rank two Higgs bundles, we will discuss an explicit construction of the Cohen-Macaulayfication of the spectral variety. In addition, we will discuss several applications using the spectral base to the topology of projective variety. This talk is based on some collaborative work with J. Liu and N. Mok.

		 In the space O(C,C) of entire functions, equipped with the open-compact topology, an element is called universal if its translation orbit is dense. It is hypercyclic w.r.t some translation operator if its orbit under this operator is dense. It is fully hypercyclic if it is simultaneously hypercyclic to all non-trivial translations in all directions. 

		 Universal entire functions are transcendental, hence their Nevanlinna characteristic functions grows faster than O(log r). Dinh-Sibony asked what the slowest Nevanlinna growth of universal entire curves is. In a joint work with Dinh Tuan Huynh and Song-Yan Xie, we solved their question completely, by constructing universal entire curves in CP^n whose Nevanlinna growth is slower than any given transcendental entire function.

		Bin Guo and Song-Yan Xie discovered the conflict between fully hypercyclicity and slow growth. They proved that if the growth is too slow then the hypercyclic directions in [0,2pi) has Hausdorff dimension 0.
		
		Replace C by the unit disc D, and translations by Aut(D), one can also talk about universal holomorphic discs. Transcendental functions defined on D with bounded Nevanlinna characteristic functions are called of bounded type, which is the analogous property of having slow growth. In a joint work with Bin Guo and Song-Yan Xie, we constructed universal discs in CP^n of bounded type. We also discovered a weak-conflict between fully hypercyclicity and slow growth. If the disc is of bounded type, then the hypercyclic directions in [0,2pi) has Lebesgue measure 0. </td>

In this talk, we will introduce Kirwan’s package on computing the
equivariant cohomology of GIT quotient and a blowup formula for intersection cohomology. As an application, the cohohomology of Kirwan’s resolution of GIT moduli space of cubic 4-folds is computed, where the resolution space has only isolated quotient singularities. On the other hand, the Kirwan’s resolution provides an explicit resolution of birational period map between GIT moduli space and Baily-Borel’s compactification of locally symmetric variety from the cubic 4-folds. Using this geometric input, we can obtain the intersection cohomology of Baily-Borel’s compactification.

In this talk I will explain a generalization of the construction to more spaces. The generalization usually depends on some choices and
I will give some concrete examples in the talk.

			</td>
		         <td  style="width: 500px;"> 
				The seminar "Geometry, Arithmetic and Differential Equations of Periods" (GADEPs), started in the pandemic 
				 year 2020 and its aim is to gather people in different areas of mathematics around the notion of periods which are 
				 certain multiple integrals. This is the second GADEPs conference focused on periods and Hodge theory of Calabi-Yau varieties with applications 
				 toward computing Gromov-Witten invariants. The study of higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants is one of the core problems in 
				 both symplectic and enumerative algebraic geometry. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, mirror symmetry invented by physicists 
				 has made remarkable conjectures on the differential structures of higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants known as BCOV. 
				 It uses the Hodge theory and periods of the mirror Calabi-Yau threefold. Recently, there has been many progress both 
				 in the mathematical framework of BCOV using enhanced Calabi-Yau varieties and also in proving these conjectures rigorously for quintic. 
				 The main aim of the workshop, is to gather experts ranging from enumerative algebraic geometry and Hodge theory to symplectic geometry.   </td>

			</td>
		         <td  style="width: 500px;"> 
				Stable holomorphic bundles are objects in algebraic geometry which have been studied by many people. Instanton Floer homology is an invariant of 3-manifolds, which has been used to solve many problems in the low dimensional topology. It turns out the two things are closely related: knowledge on the moduli space of stable bundles can help the calculation of Instanton Floer homology.  In this talk, I will explain this relationship and its generalization to stable parabolic bundles. This is joint work with Boyu Zhang.

			</td>
		         <td  style="width: 500px;"> 
				 In this talk, if time permits, we will discuss:

(1) classify order p group schemes over Spec(char p alg closed field) using Dieudonne modules;

(2) a new way of understanding Dieudonne modules in terms of cohomology of BG (due to Mondal);

(3) an attempt of using BG to construct a counterexample that Deligne--Illusie asked for (work of Antieau--Bhatt--Mathew);

(4) why this attempt cannot succeed (joint work in progress with Kubrak--Mondal), and how this attempt can be made successful (due to Petrov).

			</td>
		         <td  style="width: 500px;"> The tropicalization process assigns to an algbraic variety 
				 a polyhedral complex with extra structure that records certain degeneration data. 
				 In this talk, I will introduce the tropicalization of (a family of) algebraic curves 
				 and explain the connection between the geometry of the algebro-geometric side and the tropical side. 
				 I will then discuss the application of this construction to the irreducibility of Severi varieties 
				 and the moduli space of curves. This is joint work with Karl Christ and Ilya Tyomkin.

			Moduli spaces of hyperKahler manifolds and cubics 
			
			</td>
				   	        <td  style="width: 500px;"> 
							The study of moduli spaces of hyperKahler manifolds and low dimensional 
							cubic hypersurfaces is an active direction in algebraic geometry. 
							Thanks to kinds of Torelli theorem, many moduli spaces can be realized as locally 
							symmetric varieties of unitary type or orthogonal type. Hodge theory, birational geometry 
							and arithmetic geometry converge in this topic. 
							In this talk I will give a general introduction to the theory and examples, 
							and discuss the future directions.
